# HackTheBox SOC Analyst Job Role Path

## Objective

The HTB SOC Analyst Job Path served as a solid guide in building real SOC experience. I learned how to work with SIEMs by creating dashboards and queries in Elastic, practiced triaging alerts, and dug into Windows event logs using Sysmon and ETW. Along the way I simulated real attacks like DLL hijacking, PowerShell injection, and Mimikatz credential dumping, which gave me practical insight into how to detect and investigate malicious activity in a SOC environment.

### Skills Learned

- Strong understanding of SIEM concepts with hands-on experience building dashboards and KQL queries in Elastic.
- Proficiency in analyzing and interpreting Windows event logs, Sysmon telemetry, and ETW data.
- Ability to detect and investigate attack techniques such as DLL hijacking, PowerShell injection, and credential dumping with Mimikatz.
- Experience recognizing abnormal process behavior, parent-child spoofing, and malicious .NET assembly loading.
- Development of triage, alert correlation, and incident investigation skills aligned with real SOC workflows.

### Tools Used

- Elastic SIEM (ELK Stack) for log ingestion, visualization, and analysis.
- Windows Event Viewer and Sysmon for monitoring and forensic analysis of event logs.
- Process Hacker, PowerShell, and Command Prompt for system investigation and attack simulation.
- Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) and Linux Bash (Pwnbox) for cross-platform access and analysis.
- Event Tracing for Windows (ETW) for detecting abnormal process relationships and malicious .NET assembly loading.
